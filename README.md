# Android 14 (Apple Cream)
Since in 2022 (Ukraine war), Android 13 will be the
last version of Android, so its extended for no purpose.

## Did i test/use android?
I use Android 8 (Oreo) but since it died in 2021,
i can't update it to android 9 or 10 since Neffos (Tp link) didnt 
release a update for my phone, so it can be a bad sign.

## Why i made this?
For fun! Because i hate waiting until 2023
